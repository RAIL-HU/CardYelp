# CardYelp (Testing, latest version 0.9.1 Alpha)
## Introduction
This is a web app for card stores to post tournament information, inspired by YelpCamp project of Colt Steele's web developer bootcamp (as my own learning outcome of this course).

## What it does
Instead of spending time writing posts on social media like Facebook, card stores now can show their tounament information by filling in simple forms, players can browse the information and leave comments for the store and other players.

## Technology used
Node.js, Express, MongoDB, CSS, Bootstrap

## Challenges
The database structure is more complicated than Colt's version, sometimes it becomes an obstacle to keep up with Colt's course videos.

## Future Plans
1. Better and safer account management experience by integrating Auth0
2. Make one store host multiple games by changing the MongoDB database structure (adding new collections)
3. Add a personal summary page

## How to use this project
