# CardYelp (Preparing for Deployment)
## Introduction
This is a web app for card stores to post tournament information, inspired by YelpCamp project of Colt Steele's web developer bootcamp (as my own learning outcome of this course)

## What it does
Instead of spending time writing posts on social media like Facebook, card stores now can show their tounament information by filling in simple forms, players can browse the information and leave comments for the store and other players

## Technology used
Node.js, Express, MongoDB, CSS, Bootstrap

## Challenges
The database structure is more complicated than Colt's version, sometimes it became an obstacle to keep up with Colt's course videos

## Future Plans
Make one store host multiple games by changing the MongoDB database structure (adding new collections)

## How to use this project
This web app will be deployed soon using Heroku, please check back later for the link
